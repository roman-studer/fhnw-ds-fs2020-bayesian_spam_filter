    "> In probability theory and statistics, Bayes' theorem (alternatively Bayes' law or Bayes' rule) describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem)\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook is dedicated to the exploration of the Bayes' theorem through the creation of a spam filter. Bayes' theorem has many applications. For example, in statistics, bioinformatics, quality management or the filtering of e-mails. The basic idea of Bayes' theorem is that the probability of the occurrence of an event (under the condition that another event has taken place) can be calculated. The keyword is conditional probability."

    "## Description\n",
    "The probability that an email is a spam message if a word $w$ occurs is defined by the probability that word $w$ is in a spam message $s$ multiplied by the general probability that the email is a spam message $s$. This gets divided by the probability of that word occurring  in an e-mail (spam and ham combined).\n",

    "$$\n",
    "P(s \\vert w) = \\frac{P(w \\vert s)P(s)}{P(w \\vert s\\cup h)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To decide if an email is spam, we need to get a single probability $p$ for the whole email and not just for the single words ($p_1$ to $p_n$). Because the spam filter uses a bayesian approach we can achieve this by multiplying the probabilities for every word together and dividing by the combined probability of every word for being in a spam message plus the combined probability of every word for _not_ being in a spam message. The formula to achieve this looks as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P = \\frac{p_1 p_2 ... p_n}{p_1 p_2 ... p_n + (1- p_1)(1-p_2)...(1-p_n)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the probability of an e-mail being spam we need to _decide_ if the e-mail is a spam message or not. This falls into decision theory and is not part of this work. Nevertheless, we want a functional classifier. With the help of a rudimentary parameter search we can define a limit value. If the spamminess of an email is higher than that threshold value, it is classified as spam and gets the value 1 (spam). Below this value it is a harmless e-mail and receives the value 0 (ham)."

    "The probability that a word is found in a spam email ($P(w \\vert s)$) is defined by the number of occurrences of the word in spam emails divided by the total number of spam emails. The same goes for the probability that a word is in a ham email ($P(w \\vert \\lnot s)$). This approach does not take into account if a word is in an email multiple times or in what relation the words are to each other. This means that context does not affect anything.

    "What are the consequences of deciding to treat a new observation as class 1 vs. 0? If we falsely classify a legitimate e-mail as spam the customer could lose trust in the spam filter or miss crucial information that has been sent to him. The false-positive number should be as low as possible to prohibit that. A high accuracy also ensures that most emails get classified correctly which means that false negatives fall as well. The above-created spam classifier achieves this reasonably well for a prototype. There is still much room for improvement. The false negatives are numerous which stick out like a sore thumb. A way to tune that would be to focus on words that appear regularly because they are a better indicator than words that appear only a few times, which carry less meaning. \n",

    "All in all the classifier is a success for a simple exercise. We achieved an accuracy of over 94%."
